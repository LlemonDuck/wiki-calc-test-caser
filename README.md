# Wiki Calc Test Caser

Automatically generates test cases for 
[The OSRS Wiki DPS Calculator](https://github.com/weirdgloop/osrs-dps-calc).

After hitting a max hit, it will record your prayers, gear, etc. and copy the test code to clipboard.
May produce incorrect results if you are flicking prayers / changing gears / etc.
Also may require some small tweaks to the output code.
